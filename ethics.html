      The article talked about how ethics is really important when it comes to information technology and how it's used in today's world. It explained how IT is everywhere now from phones to hospitals and that means the people who work with this stuff have a lot of responsibility. The article pointed out how things like privacy, security, honesty, and protecting user data are some of the main ethical concerns in IT. It also mentioned that tech workers have to think about how their decisions affect others, especially when it comes to things like hacking, data leaks, and fake info. It also shows that if we don't take ethics seriously in tech it can be used negatively to take advantage of a lot of people. It's important that the people building and using technology follow rules and make choices that help everyone, not just benefit themselves financially. We need to make sure that ethics stays a big part of tech, especially as it keeps growing in power and reach in our everyday lives.
